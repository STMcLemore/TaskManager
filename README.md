# TaskManager

Task Manager is a simple to-do list/task tracking software that lets you add, edit, mark complete, and delete tasks. 

The "Active Tasks" page displays all active yet-to-be completed tasks and allows you to mark a task as complete, edit the details of a task, or delete a task from the list. 

The "Add New Task" page allows you to add your own task using a form to enter task details such as title, description, priority, due date, and task type (once, daily, weekly, or monthly). After adding a new task, it will be displayed back on the "Active Tasks" page along with any other uncompleted tasks. 

The "Completed Tasks" page lets you view a list of all completed tasks currently in the database. From this page you can delete individual completed tasks from the database, or use the "Delete All" button to delete all completed tasks from the database and clear the list.

To run this program, click the green code button on this page and copy the address for the repo. Use the address you copied to create a clone of this repository on your local machine. Once the repo has been cloned and the project has loaded, you can then run the program. When the program loads, you will be brought to the active tasks page. You will see some sample data seeded to the database that you can interact with using the "Mark Complete," "Edit Task," and "Delete" buttons. From the navbar on the left, you navigate to the "Add New Task" page to add your own tasks or to the "Completed Tasks" page to view a list of tasks marked complete.

- Make your application an API. 

- Make your application a CRUD API.

- Make your application asynchronous.

- Add comments to your code explaining how you are using at least 2 of the solid principles (TaskObject class).
